<p>IRIS (pronounced ai-ri-s) is the Openflow-based Resursive SDN Openflow Controller created by SDN Research Section, ETRI.
iNaaS is IRIS Network As A Service.</p>

<p>In Greek mythodology, Iris is the goddess of the rainbow as well as the messenger of the other gods. 
We named our controller after Iris in the hopes of creating a control plane architecture 
that can effectively deliver network policies to the underlying data plane.</p>

<p>Technically, IRIS is built on Beacon-like NIO-based event handler. On top of the IO engine, 
we have ported many of Floodlight core/application modules including Learning Switch, 
Link Discovery, Topology Manager, Device Manager, Forwarding, Firewall, and Static Flow Entry Pusher.
Further, we have enhanced the Firewall module, and newly introduced a Nettwork Failover Module. </p>

<p>Though a large portion of the IRIS functions take after those of Floodlight and Beacon, 
we did not want to stop at merely creating an improved version of the famous open-source controllers. 
Our vision was to create an SDN controller platform with the following features 
(* not all of these are to be included in the open-source IRIS):</p>

<ol>
<li>Horizontal Scalability for carrier-grade network</li>
<li>High Availability with transparent failover from failure</li>
<li>Multi-domain support with recursive network abstraction based on Openflow</li>
<li>Virtual Network SDN Controller based OpenStack</li>
</ol>

<p>We strived to satisfy above qualities with much simpler architecture 
that facilitates developers to comfortably use and customize. 
To do so, we have re-factored Floodlight a lot, successfully simplifying it to give better performance 
and maintain an easy-to-learn development model. Further, IRIS REST API is designed to be fully compliant 
with that of Floodlight, so that the current Floodlight applications can be easily transferred to IRIS.</p>

<p>We have also modified the basic Floodlight UI to give users an easier view of the network topology. 
Some of its improvements in the IRIS UI enable zoom-in, zoom-out, and panning of the network topology.</p>
